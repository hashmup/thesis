@article{Cappello2000,
abstract = {The hybrid memory model of clusters of multiprocessors raises two issues: programming model and performance. Many parallel programs have been written by using the MPI standard. To evaluate the pertinence of hybrid models for existing MPI codes, we compare a unified model (MPI) and a hybrid one (OpenMP fine grain parallelization after profiling) for the NAS 2.3 benchmarks on two IBM SP systems. The superiority of one model depends on 1) the level of shared memory model parallelization, 2) the communication patterns and 3) the memory access patterns. The relative speeds of the main architecture components (CPU, memory, and network) are of tremendous importance for selecting one model. With the used hybrid model, our results show that a unified MPI approach is better for most of the benchmarks. The hybrid approach becomes better only when fast processors make the communication performance significant and the level of parallelization is sufficient.},

@article{textX,
abstract = {TextX is a meta-language and a tool for building Domain-Specific Languages in Python. It's built on top of the Arpeggio PEG parser and takes away the burden of converting parse trees to abstract representations from language designers.From a single grammar description, textX constructs Arpeggio parser and a meta-model in run-time. The meta-model contains all the information about the language and a set of Python classes inferred from grammar rules. The parser will parse programs/models written in the new language and construct Python object graph a.k.a + the model conforming to the meta-model.The textX tool has support for error reporting, debugging, and meta-model and model visualization. It is used in industrial environments and teaching . Domain-Specific Languages course at the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad.It is a free and open-source software available at GitHub under the MIT license.},
